-The board game hex

-The 'original-no-backend' folder contains the code for a static website that allows you to play hex against your self. 

-Hex is a two-player board game. One player, red, gets the top and bottom of the board. The other player, blue, gets the left and right side of the board. 
Players take turns placing tiles on emtpy spots on the board, and the first one to connect their two sides wins.

-The game is hosted on an Amazon EC2 t2 micro instance.
