# Hex
* Hex is a 2-player board game.
* Each player's goal is to connect their two sides by a continuous path of hexagons of their color.
* Players take turn changing the color of one hexagon on the board; once chosen, the color of a hexagon cannot be changed.
* The four corners of the hex board are on both players' side.
* To play download the hexagons.html, hexagons.css, and hexagons.js files and open the hexagons.html file using Live Server, a Visual Studio Code extension.
